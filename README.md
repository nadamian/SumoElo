# SumoElo
Elo system adapted for sumo wrestling
The point of this project is to create and maintain an Elo system for the top division of sumo wrestling.
The eventual goal is not only to maintain an Elo system to rank wrestlers but to analyze the predictive capabilities
of such a system in sports. The project is more suited to a language like python, but I created this project when Java
was the only language I was familliar with. Eventually I will likely create a more sophisticated version in python or R.
At the moment my goal is to move away from the user input based system that uses text files as saves and replace it with 
an automated process that gets information directly from an API.
